# Predicting Sonic Logs using Machine Learning
This is a tutorial on how to predict sonic logs (DT) using gamma ray (GR) and neutron porosity (NPHI) logs. We will use a simple machine learning method, linear regression with multiple variable, to predict DT. This tutorial is influenced by the Machine Learning course I am currently taking on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng from Stanford. This idea of prediction using multivariable linear regression is not just limited to DT prediction, but can be use in many other instances where the varialbes are linearly dependent to each other. 

The files within this repositories are as follows:

I would like ot thank SEG for their impressive list of open-source datasets.
